## Overview of Project

### The purpose of the project is to show the trends in Kickstarter campaings based on there launch dates and outcomes.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Based on the Data the best months to launch a successful campaign are in May, June and July. The worst month to launch is December, all other month were correlated but well below the May an June for success.  

### Campaigns that asked for 5,00 and less were most successful, there was a bit os a spin in the results that showed 66% of campaigns between 35k and 50 were also successful .  

### No Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- I conclude that the best time to Launch a Kickstarter for a Play in in the month of May and June  with a goal of 5k or less. 

- I Conclude the lower the goal amount the great probability of success, with one exception the data does show that campaigns between 35k and 50k were also successful 67% of the time. 

- The data is limited to historical events and does not take into consideration current the current economic climate. Future results could be skewed based on the overall health of the economy and the ability  for people to supports the arts. 

- The data could have been measured against other sub categories with in the parent category and well as other countries using a stacked Bar Graph. The date could also have been cleansed using a Plot box graph to eliminate outliers.
